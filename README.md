**What is Redux?**

Redux is an open-source JavaScript library for managing the state of your application. It is commonly used with React, but can also be used with other frameworks such as Angular or Vue. Redux provides a centralized store to manage the state of your application, making it easier to reason about, debug, and test. 

**Why is Redux important?**

Redux can help to make your application more scalable and maintainable. By managing the state of your application in a centralized store, Redux makes it easier to manage complex state changes, track changes to your application's state over time, and simplify the process of debugging your code. Redux also provides a way to share state between components, making it easier to maintain consistency across your application.
